**_My First Game Project:_ Going Balls Clone**

This is my first game development project, where I attempted to create a clone of the hypercasual game Going Balls.

Code Quality: The code is quite basic and doesn't adhere to SOLID principles, OOP methodologies, or clean code practices.

Features:
- Currency System: The game includes a simple money system.
- Customizable Content: Players can purchase different types of balls and background images.
- Level Design: Levels were created with using the ProBuilder tool.

I used this project as a learning experience to familiarize myself with game development and various tools and techniques.
